# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Julian!

I'm 18 years old and currently training to become an **IT Specialist in Application Development**. My passion lies in bringing creative ideas to life through code and design.

## ðŸ’» What Iâ€™m Learning

- Razor
- HTML & CSS
- C#
- A little bit of Java

I'm always expanding my skills and love working on projects where I can unleash my creativity and explore new techniques.

## ðŸš€ Why I Code

I enjoy building things from scratchâ€”whether itâ€™s a small webpage, a sleek UI, or backend logic that keeps things running smoothly. Every project is an opportunity to grow and challenge myself.
